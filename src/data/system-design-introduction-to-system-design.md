### Simple Definition
- Main concepts for create and develop distributed software
- Creating architecture of different components to meet requirements of the system that we want to build

### Main Objective
- **Scalability**, make sure that application still can work fine even there is escalation of users and workload
- **High Reliability**, try to reduce time of maintaining and interruption
- **Efficiency**, optimize hardware and software resource to get best performance
- **Security**, make sure sensitive data are protected, and prevent unauthorized access to system
- **Flexibility**, system should be flexible if there is any changes of requirement or new technology

### Main Component
- **Application Architecture**, find out how components of the software can be interact and communicate each other
- **Database Structure**, choose best database approach (SQL and NoSQL), and design databases schema for manage the data
- **Caching**, use cache to store the most frequent accessed data to make software response faster
- **Load balancing**, distribute application traffic to some servers or nodes to prevent overloading
- **Security**, choose encryption method, authentication method, and access control
