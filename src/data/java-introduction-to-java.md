Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. This popularity come from very good documentation, security, and cross-platform ability. Java can be used to various kinds of software engineering, start from desktop application, website application, mobile application, and so much more. In this section we will deep dive in our powerful Java technology, start from know why Java so important and how we can start to learn about this popular technology



## What Is Java?
Java is a high level programming language which first developed by *Sun Microsystems* in 1991. One of best feature which Java have is ability to work in various kinds of software platform and operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux without effort to change main source code.
One of many privileges that Java have is JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It means that Java source code will be compiled into byte code format and can be run in cross-platform using fit JVM. JVM have responsibility to interpret byte code and run it, this make Java became very portable and platform independent.

## Why Java is Important?
Java have advantages that make it be the popular choice in programming worlds
1. Portability
It means Java can be run in cross-platform
2. Security
Java have various security layers that which allow developer to create secure and reliable app
3. Code Readability
Java programming language created which focus on readability code, it makes java much easier to learn and understand for new programmer
4. Strong Community
Java have very big and active developer community, it means we can have access to a lot of resource, tools, and support
5. Company Support
Java supported by Oracle Corporation, a big technology company that give long term guarantee for this language
